To maximize our efficiency in understanding, remembering and replicating concepts, events, formulas and any kind of information, a deeper understanding of how the human mind interprets information is needed.

Everything around us is information and as we interact with the [environment](/learning/data/environment) and [context](/learning/data/context) we also acquire new informations.
