_data, an unorganized set of stimulus_

By data, we refer to unorganized sets of [stimuluses](/learning/stimulus.md) from one or more [mediums](/learning/data/medium.md) caused by interaction with the surrounding [environment](/learning/data/environment.md) in a given [context](/learning/data/context.md). Going by this definition, we can desume that data is _what we perceive with our senses while interacting with our surroundings_.
