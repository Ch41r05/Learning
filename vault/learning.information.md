## How information works: a breakdown

![](/assets/images/information.png)

To maximize our efficiency in understanding, remembering and replicating concepts, events, formulas and any kind of information, a deeper understanding of how the human mind interprets information is needed. Usually when we think about information, we refer to concise easy-to-digest bits of knowledge but actually everything around us is information, it just happens to belong to other categories. Everything around us is information and as we interact with the [[environment|learning.environment]] and [[context|learning.context]] we also acquire new informations. What we must be sure of is to avoid misunderstandings due to the fact that we use our senses to percieve the reality we are immersed in.
