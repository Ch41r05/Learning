# Information

## How information works: a breakdown

To maximize our efficiency in understanding, remembering and replicating concepts, events, formulas and any kind of information, a deeper understanding of how the human mind interprets information is needed. Usually when we think about information, we think about concise easy-to-digest bits of knowledge but actually everything around us is information, it just happens to belong to other categories. As we interact with the [[environment|learning.environment]] and [[context|learning.context]] around us, we also acquire new informations what we must be sure of is to avoid misunderstandings due to the fact that we use our senses to percieve the reality we are immersed in.
#### [[Medium|learning.information.medium]]
What is the main vector from which we mainly acquire informations?

#### [[Granularity|learning.information.granularity]]
Which is easier to understand, an example or an abstraction of concept?

#### [[Enrichment|learning.information.enrichment]]
Should the focus only be on a subject?
