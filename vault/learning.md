# Learning

## How learning works: a breakdown

![](/assets/images/learning.png)

By learning, we refer to the process of converting acquired [[data|learning.data]] to thoughts or actions which can be recalled or replicated at will with minimum effort.
The process could be divided into four main subprocesses:

##### Collection
[[Data|learning.data]] is acquired in a given [[context|learning.context]] and [[environment|learning.environment]].

##### Persistance
[[Data|learning.data]] is converted to [[information|learning.information]] and then [[memorized|learning.memorization]].

##### Recollection
[[Memorized|learning.memorization]] [[information|learning.information]] needs to be available to be [[replicated|learning.replication]].

##### Confidence
Once able to [[replicate|learning.replication]] [[memorized|learning.memorization]] [[information|learning.information]], the aim is to minimize the time and effort needed. This could be acchieved by [[customization|learning.customization]] and [[optimization|learning.optimization]].
