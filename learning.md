## How learning works: a breakdown

![](/assets/images/learning.png)

By learning, we refer to the process of converting acquired [data](/learning/data) to thoughts or actions which can be recalled or replicated at will with minimum effort.
The process could be divided into four main subprocesses:

##### Collection

[Data](/learning/data) is acquired in a given [context](/learning/data/context) and [environment](/learning/data/environment).

##### Persistance

[Data](/learning/data) is converted to [information](/learning/information) and then [memorized](/learning/memorization).

##### Recollection

[Memorized](/learning/memorization) [information](/learning/information) needs to be available to be [replicated](/learning/replication).

##### Confidence

Once able to [replicate](/learning/replication) [memorized](/learning/memorization) [information](/learning/information), the aim is to minimize the time and effort needed. This could be acchieved by [customization](/learning/customization) and [optimization](/learning/optimization).

#### The difference between persistance and recollection

One thing to keep in mind when approaching learning methodologies, is that the concept of persistance and recollection are not necessarily linked. Did it ever happen to you that you could not remember something when you needed it, but it suddenly came to mind at anoter random time? Just think about it. The problem here is not that you didn't [memorize](/learning/memorization) but that you couldn't _remember_. So, with this simple example we could grasp that when we think we don't remember something, the problem may or may not lie in the fact that we haven't [memorized](/learning/memorization) it.
